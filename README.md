I really enjoy Freifunk. It is the most decentral network we have on a big scale. Concisely articulating shortcomings does not mean I stop liking it. Instead I want us to improve the great community and network we already have. Understanding the issue well is the foundation for an improvement. 

I am collecting ideas in this repository on how the freifunk network can be improved and further de-centralized.
If you want to contribute ideas or critical thoughts, please do get involved, raise PR, issues or otherwise engage. Having a solid understanding of what we would like the network to look like significantly increases the chances of those ideas being implemented.

Cheers

Christof
